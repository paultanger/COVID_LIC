# Country specific information

## How to read the analysis
Below, each country’s analysis contains:  

1. a graph of the LSHTM projections of COVID-19 case totals over times (all age groups combined) for an unmitigated scenario plus ten disease containment scenarios (see explanation below);
2. a crop calendar showing when the crop production phases of key staple crops occur throughout the year (with multiple crop calendars in cases where variation in timing occurs);
3. a map of the country, with the sub-national area highlighted in cases where there are multiple crop calendars per country (due to variation in timing by area);
4. a legend listing the different containment scenarios included in the LSHTM model.

## Scenario descriptions

In the LSHTM model, the researchers identify an unmitigated scenario (i.e. the government takes no action to contain the spread of COVID-19), as well as a variety of different containment scenarios.  They model the impacts and timing of the spread of COVID-19 for each scenario, as a way to estimate which approach could have the largest impact on reducing and/or delaying the cases, deaths, and other effects of COVID-19.

The ten containment scenarios involve social distancing, shielding, and/or a combination of these strategies.  The different strategies and selected scenarios are described below: 

* Greenzone shielding (GZ) was implemented in the model by stratifying the population in one shielded and one unshielded compartment. The GZ applies to those aged 60+ years. We assume shielding of this population has a coverage fraction, and reduction fraction; we refer to GZ interventions by coverage / reduction, so “80C80R shielding” is 80% coverage with 80% contact reduction to the shielded group.

* Basic Public Health & Social Measures (PHSM) was implemented as a 20% reduction in general contacts outside the home and a 25% reduction in transmission from symptomatic individuals corresponding to symptomatic people being encouraged to self isolate.

```{r scenario-table-{{names(combined.plots[i])}}, results='asis', echo = FALSE}
  # can use kable or pander
  # https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/kableExtra/vignettes/awesome_table_in_html.html
  tabledata = tabledata
  print(tabledata %>%
      kable( row.names = F, booktabs = T) %>% #caption = "Scenario Descriptions",
      kable_styling(position = "center", bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed", full_width=F, position = "center"), latex_options = c("striped", "hold_position", full_width = T) )) %>%
    column_spec(3, width = "10em")
```

## Caveats/Notes
* These are projections based on a model with documented assumptions.  That model will be updated as the LSHTM gathers more information, as noted [here](https://cmmid.github.io/topics/covid19/LMIC-projection-reports.html).
* As noted above, the ‘Day 0’ used for the graphs here is an estimation of when a country reached a date with 50 active infections.
* The quality of COVID-19-related data that is available for LMICs is variable and this likely impacts the accuracy of modeling.
* A number of COVID-19 modeling efforts are underway. The use of the LSHTM modeling for this analysis does not imply USAID endorsement of this approach over others.
* The crop calendars do not include all crops grown in the country, nor all those that are important as a food source or for income generation.
* Maps, area names, and borders do not necessarily reflect the concurrence of the US Government.
